# üì± Favourite Services App

A Flutter application built with **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and **Bloc for state management**.  
The app fetches services from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts), displays them in a scrollable list, and allows users to **favorite/unfavorite** services with local persistence (Hive/SQLite).  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Fetches services using **Dio** (`GET /posts` from JSONPlaceholder).
- Displays **All Services** and **Favorites** in a **tabbed view**.
- Users can **favorite/unfavorite** services via a heart icon.
- **Local persistence** of favorites with Hive/SQLite.
- Infinite scrolling / **lazy loading** for large lists.
- Built using **Bloc** for predictable state management.
- Written with **Stateless widget driven UI** (no function-driven widgets).
- Includes **unit tests** and **integration tests**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles:


- **Bloc** manages state and events (`DashboardBloc`).
- **Dio** handles networking.
- **Hive/SQLite** stores favorite IDs.
- **Entity-driven design** separates layers.
